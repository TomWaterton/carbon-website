# Voice and tone

> "It's not what you say, but how you say it."

How we say things is often just as important as what we say.
When we consistently use a particular voice and tone, people will tend to associate certain qualities with us.
Consistent voice and tone are crucial for connecting and resonating with users. What's the difference between voice and tone?
One way to think about it is that voice is always consistent, but tone often changes depending on context.

### Voice

Voice is the foundation for communicating about IBM products and delivering brand messages. At IBM, our voice expresses the core of our personality,
while bringing comfort, ease, and a sense of connection to our users. Through careful use of the IBM voice, we help empower users to meet their business goals.

### Tone

Tone conveys an attitude toward both the subject matter and the reader. All content – whether it's introductory text in the UI, an error message,
or a topic in the docs – tells part of a bigger story. Good storytellers are skilled in two main areas: what they are saying (the substantive content)
and how to say it to any given audience (the style and tone in which it is presented). Be a good storyteller.

### Conversational levels

Content should never feel complex, distant, or disjointed. Rather, it should feel like a conversation with a smart friend: personal, relatable, helpful, and engaging.
Here's a quick guide to conversational levels, based on the six stages of the user journey:

#### Less conversational

Instructions to help a user complete a task. Example:

_Go to Avatar icon > Account > Notifications to set up general account and spending notifications.
Spending notifications are available only for Subscription and Pay-As-You-Go account owners._

#### More conversational

Welcome pages and standard interface content. Example:

_To start using IBM Cloud, name your first organization. Think of an org as a project or team that
shares resources, such as apps, databases, and other services. Orgs exist in geographic regions,
so decide where you'd like to put your first one._

#### Most conversational

Content for the discover, try, buy phases of the user journey. Example:

_Watson Assistant comes pre-trained with industry-relevant content. It can make sense of your
historical chat or call logs, and it has a visual dialog editor — meaning it's never been easier
to get started (developers not required)._

# Content principles

> "One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple."

> <cite>– Jack Kerouac</cite>

<AnchorLinks small>
  <AnchorLink to="#show-dont-tell">Show don't tell</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Focus on user action</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Speak directly to the user</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Be clear but concise</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Use simple words</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Be respectful</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Use short sentences</AnchorLink>
</AnchorLinks>

## Show don't tell

The layout, flow, visual design, and microinteractions used in our UIs should all help inform people about how to use our products.
Obviously text has a role to play too, but the presence of lots of explanatory text in a UI should prompt the question:
Is there a better way of conveying this information to the user?

Consider using examples, images, or videos rather than large blocks of text.

## Focus on user action

Like everything we produce, our written content should focus on bringing value to the user.
In general, begin with the user goal (the what), then state how to achieve it.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="To add a node into your flow, drag the node icon onto the canvas."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

## Speak directly to the user

In general, speak directly to the user.
Much of the time this will result in using the second person pronoun ("you").
When appropriate, use the user's name.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Welcome back, Jack. Tip: You can create a copy of an existing flow and use it as the starting point for a new flow."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

## Be clear but concise

Only cover what is really essential for the user to know. Omit common introductory phrases such as ‘you must,’ ‘due to the fact that’, ‘in order to’, etc.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Save changes?"
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      text="Would you like to save changes?"
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>
Remember that you can make supplementary information available via an expandable section, a tooltip, or a “more information” type link.

## Use simple words

The terminology we use can have a huge impact on the usability of a product, so give this careful consideration.

- ~~In as far as is humanly possible, endeavor to avoid verboseness and tautology in your written communication.~~
  Use simple, clear, direct language.
- See the [Glossary](/guidelines/content/glossary) for common UI terms and action labels
- Don't invent words or apply new meanings to standard words. This way lies confusion.
- Know your user and ask yourself what terms and phrases they use then carry out user research to verify the suitability of these terms.
- When you have determined key terms, use them consistently. Don’t use different terms (or variations of the same term) to refer to the same thing.
- Don’t use complex or lengthy words where simpler, shorter equivalents are available.

Some examples:

| Avoid complex words and phrases | Use simpler alternatives |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| additional                      | extra                    |
| assist                          | help                     |
| commence                        | start                    |
| execute                         | run                      |
| initiate                        | start                    |
| in order to                     | to                       |
| in the event of                 | if                       |
| leverage                        | use                      |
| prior to                        | before                   |
| purchase                        | buy                      |
| terminate                       | end                      |
| utilize                         | use                      |

## Be respectful

Sometimes users do unexpected things and errors can occur, but we should never blame our users in our product messages.
Instead, focus on how the user can fix the problem.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Please check the email address."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      text="You’ve entered an incorrect email."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

## Use short sentences

Remember that people don't tend to read web content, they scan it. This is especially true when people are presented with lots of text.
If your sentence is more than about 25 words long, consider splitting it up.

Similarly, keep any paragraphs short and focused. Within a product UI, paragraphs should be 1-2 sentences in length.

# Language and grammar

<AnchorLinks small>
  <AnchorLink>Use standard US English spelling</AnchorLink>

</AnchorLinks>

## Use standard US English spelling

Use standard US English spellings.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="The artifact is colored gray."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample text="The artefact is coloured grey." aspectRatio="1:1" />
  </Column>
</Row>

We can all make typos or forget how to spell a particular word, so always run your UI text through a spell checker.
It's also always worth getting someone else to review your copy before it gets published.

- See the [Glossary](/guidelines/content/glossary) for common UI terms and action labels
- For other words, refer to [Merriam-Webster's online dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)

> “If a word in the dictionary were misspelled, how would we know?”

## Use contractions

Users don't want to read more characters than necessary and we want to present a conversational style.
So do use simple, commonly understood contractions such as _can't_, _don't_, _isn't_, etc.

However, avoid complex contractions that involve combining more than two words (e.g. do not write _wouldn't've_ or _shouldn't've_).

> "Contractions: What's not to like?"

## Use the active voice

In an active voice construction, the subject performs the action (e.g. _Sarah publishes the application_).
In contrast, in a passive voice construction, the target of the action is emphasized (e.g. _The application is published_).

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Product X scans files for viruses before uploading them to the web server."
      caption="Correct use of the active voice."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      text="Files are scanned for viruses and, if cleared, uploaded to the web server."
      caption="Here it's not totally clear who or what scans the files."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

- In general, the active voice is preferable because it emphasizes action and progress.
- The active voice also makes clear who or what is performing the action, which can often be hidden in passive voice constructions.
- Sentences written in the active voice also tend to be shorter than those written in the passive voice.

**Exception:** Using the passive voice is occasionally useful though - such as when you want to avoid blaming the user:

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Error: An incorrect value was entered."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

## Use simple verb forms

Wherever possible, use simple, single-word verb forms. This makes text easier to understand for all.

For example, avoid using verb phrases when the verb alone will suffice.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Start the monitoring service."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample text="Start up the monitoring service." aspectRatio="1:1" />
  </Column>
</Row>

## Don't confuse verbs and nouns

Here are a few commonly confused verbs and nouns:

- You might _advise_ (verb) someone on how to do something. They will no doubt be grateful for the _advice_ (noun).
- Network bandwidth will _affect_ (verb) download speeds. An _effect_ (noun) of slow download speeds might be user frustration.
- To _compile_ (verb) the code, do X. After _compilation_ (noun) you can run the code.
- First you need to _install_ (verb) the software. When the _installation_ (noun) completes you will see a welcome screen.
- You might _invite_ (verb) someone to take part in the product beta. This might involve sending them an _invitation_ (noun).

## Use the present tense

There are thirteen verb tenses in the English language, but thankfully, we rarely need to use most of these when writing text for our product UIs.
In general, write using simple, present tense verbs.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample type="do" text="Message sent" aspectRatio="1:1" />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample text="Your message has been sent" aspectRatio="1:1" />
  </Column>
</Row>

## Use one term per concept

Don’t use different terms (or variations of the same term) to refer to the same thing.
If you use _app_ and _application_ or _repo_ and _repository_ in the same context, a user might well start to question whether you are referring to one thing or to two separate things.

Also, avoid overloading one term with different meanings. If a certain component or process or concept is called one thing,
avoid using this same term to mean anything else. This might sound blindingly obvious, but is, sadly, all too common.

> “A synonym is a word you use when you can’t spell the other one.”

## Phrases vs full sentences

It's fine to use phrases (as opposed to full sentences) in appropriate contexts, such as for headings, button labels, confirmation messages, etc.

Page headings are a good example of where it's preferable to use short, sharp phrases (without periods) rather than full sentences.

Use your judgement as to whether phrases or full sentences are most appropriate in your product context - and then be consistent.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample type="do" text="Remove photo?" aspectRatio="1:1" />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      text="Are you sure that you want to remove these photos?"
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

## The use of pronouns

A pronoun is used in place of a noun. Sounds simple, but be careful not to fall into any of the following pitfalls:

- Don’t use a plural pronoun (_they_, _their_, _theirs_, _them_, or _themselves_) to refer to a singular noun. (While this usage is fairly common, it is grammatically incorrect.)
- Don’t use gender-specific pronouns such as _he_, _him_, _himself_, _his_ or _she_, _her_, _herself_, _hers_ when the subject could be either gender.
- Don’t try to cover both genders by using a construction such as _he/she_, _(s)he_, _him/her_, _his/hers_, etc.
- Don’t use _it_ to refer to a person.

So what's ~~a guy~~ ~~a girl~~ one to do?

- You can use the imperative mood to avoid needing a pronoun at all.
- Use a second person pronoun: you, your, yours, or yourself.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Use the Publish wizard to deploy the application."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="You can now deploy your application."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

> When I was a kid, my teacher looked my way and said, “Name two pronouns.” I said, “Who, me?”

## The use of non-English words

You may think it _très chic_ to scatter a few foreign words and phrases into your copy, but is this really a good idea? _Au contraire, mon amie!_

In general, avoid using foreign (i.e. non-English) words and phrases as these increase the complexity of our text and can make us look a little pretentious. _Sacré bleu!_

Exceptions:
Feel free to use the following commonly used Latin abbreviations:

- i.e. (meaning _that is_ or _in other words_)
- e.g. (meaning _for example_)
- etc. (meaning _and so on_)

## Don't use jargon

We need to speak the language that our users speak. Most real people don’t speak in technical or business jargon and neither should we.

Jargon can take different forms:

- The use of specialist terms, not widely understood outside of a narrow field or discipline (e.g. _unquiesce the database_).
- Taking common words but applying them to new contexts, or using them to mean something different from how those words are widely used and understood
  (e.g. _socialize the report_; _massage the data points_).
- Making use of figurative language (e.g. _touch base_; _cherry pick any quick wins_; _drink your own champagne_).

Also, avoid cliches like the plague\*

Some examples:

| Jargon to avoid      | Guidance                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| drill down           | Use a more direct term such as _refine_, _explore_, or _expand_.                                                             |
| drive                | Don't use in the abstract sense of driving change, etc. Use a more concrete verb such as _control_, _manage_, or _increase_. |
| facilitate           | Don’t use in an abstract sense such as to facilitate progress. Instead, say something specific about how you are helping.    |
| going forward        | Use _in future_ or a similar, more concrete phrase.                                                                          |
| monetize             | Re-word if possible to use more natural language, such as _chargeable_ or _paid plans_, etc.                                 |
| no holds barred      | If there are no restrictions, it is clearer to write something such as _without restrictions_.                               |
| opinionated          | Don’t use in relation to inanimate objects or tools.                                                                         |
| religion / religious | Don’t use to refer to a person or group taking a particular stance or approach to something.                                 |
| sea change           | Simplify to _change_ or, if further emphasis is needed, _significant change_.                                                |
| socialize            | You might socialize with friends after work, but you _publish_ or _share_ a report.                                          |
| synergy              | Re-word if possible to use more natural language.                                                                            |

\*See what we did there? 😉
